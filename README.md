# N2Ccarbon credit platfomr for Solana
Developing process:
The N2C Carbon-Crypto White Paper provides a brief description of the process of developing carbon credits into a carbon pool within the Solana NFT ecosystem. This involves minting the NFT carbon pool with a smart program and subsequently converting from a carbon pool to sub-NFT carbon credit certificates, which are available in a range of specifications.
The platform will allow users to upload carbon credit NFTs for trading. It will also include a carbon footprint tracker and a carbon legal verifier. Furthermore, it will enable users to map RWA carbon asset values to tokens. It will also function as an enterprise carbon offset execution platform. Additionally, it will generate ESG carbon footprint reports. Finally, it will include an N2C Tokens Economic Model that covers token issuance and burning.
